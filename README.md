# Minimalistic ToDo app made with Django framework and SQLite.

To run the project use the command while navigated inside the project folder:

```
py manage.py runserver
```

This will start a development server for this app. Feel free to send your feedback and suggestions to my email `mpp14021972@gmail.com`.
